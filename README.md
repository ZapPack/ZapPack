## Projects
### Familiar Texture Update
This is my longest running, and most involved project. It's a Minecraft resource pack that is meant to restore the look of the game's textures back to their pre-Texture Update counterparts while emulating the _style_ of the new textures.<br>

### Updated JAPPA Texture Revisions
While somewhat related to the concept for _Familiar Texture Update_, this is simply a port of JAPPA's Texture Update revisions (which were discontinued for obvious reasons). Some textures had to be adapted by me, but they are all directly based on JAPPA's work.<br><br>
